In \sw, a community of over 30\,000 % note: SI rule forbids to use , or . for separation of 1000th (9. conference, 1948, Resolution 7) http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/9/7/
volunteers searched for lensed candidates in the Canada--France--Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS).
59 new lens candidates have been identified, along with rediscovery of 60\% of the previously-known candidates.\scite{sw2}

We propose that volunteers should play an integral part in the modeling of lens candidates as well.
We implemented \spl, a method allowing non-professionals to create mass models for those discovered lens candidates and to be usable in a citizen-science environment.
Tests with simulated lenses show that models by experienced volunteers are comparable to those by experts.\scite{Kueng2015}
We present models of most of the \sw lens candidates that were produced collaboratively by a small community of lens enthusiasts from the volunteer community.
These models allow for further analysis.

\section{Introduction}

Gravitational lenses, predicted by A. Einstein's General Relativity in 1915 have become an important tool in cosmology.
Strong lensing can be used to infer the distribution of dark matter around galaxies \ccite{Koopans2009}, to find the relation between stars and dark matter \ccite{Leier2011} or to infer cosmological parameters \ccite{Sereno2014}.

Current surveys resulted in more than 400 known lenses.
For example in the \sw project, carried out on the 170 square degree Canada--France--Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS), over 30\,000 volunteers found 59 candidate lenses.\scite{sw1,sw2}

As a rough estimate, this results in one lens every few square degree.
Imaging surveys under way will increase the observation area by a factor of ten and next generation surveys starting in the twenty--twenties will increase the resolution leading to another increase by a factor of ten.\scite{Marshall2005,OguriMarshall2010}
This raises expectations that the number of lenses will increase a hundred fold, leading to an order of 10\,000 lenses over the next 10 years.
That's of order one potential lens detection per hour for the next 10 years.

Software robots in combination with the citizen science project \sw are proposed to classify that amount of raw data and identify possible lens candidates.\scite{Marshall2009,sw1}
For the modelling of the mass distribution of the lenses --- an essential part of any research involving lenses --- we propose to involve citizen scientists as well and present a concept, that has already been implemented and tested: \spl.\scite{Kueng2015}
In this work we reintroduce \spl and present a novel extension that facilitates the cooperation among the volunteers, as well as an almost complete set of models for all of the lensing candidates presented in \icite{sw2}.


\section{Theoretical background and implementation}

This section is a short summary from \icite{Kueng2015} and recaps the basic concepts of \spl.
It follows the formulation of Fermat's principle as described in \icite{Blandford1986}.

Consider a lens at redshift $z_L$ away from the observer with a planar mass distribution proportional to $\kappa(x,y)$, the convergence.
Imagine a light source at distance $z_s$, behind the point $(x_s,y_s)$ on the lens.
A photon flying from the source through the lens at $(x,y)$ to the observer will have an increased light travel time compared to the direct way through $(x_s,y_s)$.
The time delay can be expressed as two parts:
\begin{equation*}  \label{eq:tarriv}
  t(x,y) = t_{\rm geom} + t_{\rm grav} ,
\end{equation*}
where the first part represents a geometrical time delay:
\begin{equation*} \label{eq:tgeom}
  \tgeom(x,y) \propto (x-x_s)^2 + (y-y_s)^2 ,
\end{equation*}
and the second the delay due to general relativity:
\begin{equation*} \label{eq:tgrav}
  \tgrav(x,y) = \left\langle \tgrav(x_\subcirc,y_\subcirc) \right\rangle
                + (1+z_L) \frac{2G}{c^3} M(x_\subbullet,y_\subbullet) \,.
\end{equation*}

The arrival time surface $t(x,y)$ applies to virtual photons.
Real photons take paths where $t(x,y)$ is stationary, due to Fermat's principle.
This arrival time surface has an exact relation to the lens-mass distribution and the source position.
A simple sketch of this surface (i.e. the location of minima, maxima and saddle points, and the self intersection contour though saddle points) is thus a sufficient starting point for finding a corresponding lensing mass distribution $\kappa(x,y)$ with uncertainties.
Further details about this approach and the technical implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings sampling technique are described in \icite{Lubini2012}.

In \spl we ask volunteers to provide an intuitive guess of the arrival time surface based on the survey image to determine the mass distribution of a lens.
The resulting model configuration is then rendered to provide a direct visual feedback.
This direct feedback allows the user to improve upon his initial guess and to match the two images.
The user interface depicting this process is shown in \figref{ui}.
What is called a \spl model is actually an ensemble of 200 models, each a possible solution to the constraints. The uncertainty is the range of parameters covered by all the models of the whole ensemble.

  }
  \label{fig:ui}
\end{figure}


\section{Collaborative modeling}

A novel component presented in this work is the ability of the users to easily share and discuss their work with others.
After creating a model, the volunteer uploads his results to the server and receives a link to an overview page\footnote{Example model: \url{http://labs.spacewarps.org/spaghetti/model/AJIBCHQ6EM}} containing various data of that model.
These links can easily be shared to an online forum\footnote{\url{http://talk.spacewarps.org}}, allowing discussion amongst different volunteers.
Using one of these links, other members of the community can try to revise existing models.
This leads to a tree of models for a particular candidate.
Feedback from experts and other modelers prune the tree to select the most plausible models.
An actual tree of models for the \sw lens candidate \SW{5} is shown in \figref{tree}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{modeltree}
  \caption{
    Tree of models for the \sw lens candidate \SW{5}
  }
  \label{fig:tree}
\end{figure}


JW reported on a collaborative modeling effort of the early \sw candidate \SW{1} that resulted in a much larger tree of models in a letter published online.\footnote{\url{http://letters.zooniverse.org/letters/86-collaborative_gravitational_lens_modelling_using_spaghettilens_a_spacewarps_project}}


\section{Results: models for the candidates}

We report a full set of model trees (351 unique models) for most of the 59 candidates presented in \icite{sw2} that allow for further analysis of the list of candidates.
An overview is presented in \tabref{results}, where the count of created models and the extracted averaged total mass of the lenses are listed.
The missing three candidates are particular challenging to model for the volunteers and need further investigation.



% 
% \subsection{Determing lensing and stellar mass}
% 
% In a next step, we extracted the total lensing mass and the stellar mass and compared the ratio, to get a first overview over the condidates and to reject possible non--lenses.
% 
% The lensing mass can directly be extracted from the generated models, as the mass distribution is the key feature that is being modelled \icite{Kueng2015}.
% Since a single model actually consists of an ensemble of a number of models, where each one is a possible configuration, we get an approximation of the error by selecting the models with minimal/ maximal total mass as lower / upper bounds for the errors.
% 
% We estimated the stellar mass with:
% \[
%   \Mstel = 10^{0.4 [\operatorname{mag}(z_\text{ph}) - m_\text{i}]}
% \]
% where
% $z_\text{ph}$ and $m_\text{i}$ are the photometric redshift and luminosity given in \icite{sw2} and 
% $\operatorname{mag}()$ is a function obtained by interpolating data of SDSS-i magnitude (AB) of 1\Msun and actual mass vs redshift BC03 models \icite{Bruzual2003}, Salpeter Initial Mass Function and assumes ``vanilla cosmology'' ($\Omega_\text{M}=0.3$, $\Omega_\Lambda=0.7$).\scite{Ferreras2010}
% For the lower bound of the error we assumed a young population (0.5 Gyr), whereas for the upper one of 2 Gyr.
% 
% \begin{figure}
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{plot}
%   \caption{Stellar Mass \Mstel vs. Lensing Mass \Mlens. Stellar Mass errors are the difference between junior (0.5 Gyr) and senior (2 Gyr) population; Lensing Mass errors represent the minimum and maximum values of an ensemble (``a model'').}

\section{Conclusions}

In this work we use the method presented and tested in \icite{Kueng2015} to collaboratively create 351 models of all but three of the 59 lens candidates discovered by the first run of \sw.
This collection of models and their parameters allow for further analysis, as demonstrated by the extraction of the total (lensing) mass \Mlens of the candidates using the generated models.
For example, future analysis could show the relation between lensing mass \Mlens and stellar mass \Msun, determined by photometric redshift and luminosity given in \icite{sw2} to possibly reject some candidates.

% \section{The First Section: Titles are Capitalized with the Usual First Letter Rules}
% \subsection{Subsections only have the first letter of the entire title capitalized}
% 
% Subsections only have the first letter of the first word capitalized (except for words that are naturally capitalized). For a very short contribution it is not necessary to use the sectioning commands.
% 
% You may also use the ``graphicx" package and use its related commands if you are already familiar with that figure insertion method. Word template files are discouraged, allowed as a last resort for those people who have some difficulties with \LaTeX.
% 
% Since the World Scientific proceedings style \cite{ws} uses numbered superscript citations of the bibliography items, one has to be careful to use 
% \verb|\refcite| to get a baseline normal size number to include in an in-line direct reference, best formatted in the style: 
%  ``see Ref.$\sim$\verb|\refcite|\{\ldots\}" while normal superscript citations follow punctuation  as in ``.\verb|\cite|\{\ldots\}"  For example, here is an in line citation to Ref.~\refcite{arxiv}. On the other hand citations at the end of a sentence are done line this.\cite{lamp94}
% 
% \subsection{You can safely ignore this}
% 
% The white space above the title in the ws-procs975x65.cls document style is eliminated by commenting out two lines in the definition of the macro \verb|\title|, namely:\\  
%  \verb|\vspace|*\{-14pt\} \\ \verb|\vskip| 59pt\\
% but you do not need to know this if you use the proceedings style files downloaded from the MG14 website. This gives a bit more space for text content in short articles.
